###Project Overview
I develop a single page application featuring a map of Orlando shopping malls. The application has functionality added to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. In this application I use Google maps API to create the map and place the markers, FourSquare API to populate the marker popup window and a ModelView approach by using the knockout.js library together with some jQuery. This project is written from scratch, everything written here is my work.
